_Welcome._ This is a website to document my programming-related endeavours.

Iâ€™ve got Rust/Kotlin/Python to learn and use, projects to work on, the `polars` dataframe library to learn, potentially some data to visualise, and some natural language to process. And types! Lots and lots of sum and product types to create (hopefully) â€“Â Iâ€™m really looking forward to that. ðŸ˜ƒ

As of 2025 I work as a data manager, which confuses people because they tend to think that I manage people when thatâ€™s really not the case.

My role is really broadly defined, in the same way that the concept of data is broadly defined, and therefore the management of it correspondingly has a broad scope. This might actually be an apt description:

```python
def managing_data(x: anything) -> bool:
    return True

while managing_data(whatever_that_entails):
    ians_professional_life()
```

All of which is to say that Iâ€™m still figuring out what my role entails. My manager, who manages actual human beings for a living (and not data), might be mildly unhappy to hear this, so shush. ðŸ¤«
